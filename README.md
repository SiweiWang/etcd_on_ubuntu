Running an etcd Cluster on Ubuntu 14.04

These files were created to allow users to use Vagrant (http://www.vagrantup.com) to quickly and relatively easily spin up a cluster running etcd 2.0 (etcd 2.0.9 was the version specifically tested). The configuration was tested using Vagrant 1.7.2 and virtualbox 5.0.16r105871
